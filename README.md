## My process

I set up the accordion in HTML, followed by the CSS properties. Then I added JS and made the overall site mobile-friendly. 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was my first opportunity to code an accordion. I'm pleased with how it turned out. 

### Continued development

The Javascript works, but the code is a bit untidy. Something to work on in future projects. 

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript/) - I found this post useful in structuring the accordion's HTML.
